# DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)

![DSA Image](dsa_logo.jpg))

## Introduction

Welcome to the DSA repository! This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in various programming languages. It serves as a reference for learning, revising, and practicing DSA concepts, whether you're preparing for interviews, improving your problem-solving skills, or working on competitive programming.

## Contents

The repository is organized into the following categories:

- **Arrays**: Solutions and implementations of common array-based problems.
- **Linked Lists**: Implementations of singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and problems based on them.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Classic stack and queue problems, including variations like deque and priority queue.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and tree traversal algorithms.
- **Graphs**: Graph representation, traversal (BFS, DFS), shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall).
- **Sorting and Searching**: Implementation of sorting algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort) and search algorithms (Binary Search).
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solutions to common dynamic programming problems, such as the knapsack problem and longest common subsequence.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Problems and solutions involving the greedy approach.
- **Others**: Additional algorithms and data structures not covered in the above categories.

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you should have a basic understanding of programming and the following installed:

- A compiler or interpreter for your preferred language (e.g., Python, C++, Java).
- Basic command-line knowledge to compile and run programs.

## Usage

You can navigate through the folders to find implementations and problem solutions. Each folder contains relevant code files and, in some cases, problem descriptions and explanations.
